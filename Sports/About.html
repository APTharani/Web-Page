     <h1>Sports in India</h1>
     <p>India has a history of sports dating back thousands of years. Cricket is the most popular spectator sport; it generates the highest television viewership, with the Indian Premier League (IPL) being the most-followed league in the country. Football has also gained popularity,with the Indian Super League (ISL) being the highest level of domestic football, and the national team winning multiple gold medals at the Asian and South Asian Games. </p>
     <p>India has hosted the Cricket World Cup three times and won it twice. Field hockey is the most successful sport for India at the Olympics, with the Indian men's team winning twelve Olympic medals eight of which were gold. Although it is not considered a professional sport, cycling is a recreational activity and exercise in India</p>
     <p>The modern game of badminton developed from an English children's game known as battledore and shuttlecock, a game that was most prominent in ancient India. The battledore was a paddle and the shuttlecock was a small feathered cork, colloquially called a bird</p>
     <p>India has a rich heritage of martial arts. In the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana, Bhima and Hanuman were the greatest Gadadhari (transl.â€‰One who fights with Gada (the Mace weapon)) and were skilled in wrestling.</p>
     <p>The Mahabharata is a tale of warring cousins, composed over several years. It was believed that this book contained all aspects of Indian life, and whatever was said which was not in the book was not true. Going back to the history of sports, martial arts was one of the earliest sport used for military purposes.</p>
     <p>Board games, including chess and snakes and ladders, originated from the ancient Indian games chaturanga and gyan chauper respectively; these were later brought to foreign countries, where they would be modernized.[28][29] Chaturanga taught ancient Indians how to strategise for war, and the other board games often imparted spiritual values</p>
